Project Specifications:
Your final project will be a polished application that you will present to class this Friday afternoon at 2pm. This project should be showcase ready - something to show potential employers. You can build off of a previous assignment/project/workshop, but you must make significant improvements/additions. The application can be front end, but I encourage you to make it fullstack and use Node and Postgres. The requirements are:

    Must have a database or make an API call 
    Clear and clean UI 
    logical git commits
    contains a README that explains how to start your app 
    If using a previous assignment, substantial improvements are made
